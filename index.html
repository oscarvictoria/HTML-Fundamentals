           The word "tags" are interchangeable with "elements"  
        </h1>
            <p> Some things that I learned while reading on this subject are that the main structure of a website has to have tags also know as elements to indicate what kind of format to display it on the front end.</p>
        <h2>
            Attributes tell us more about elements 
        </h2>
        <p>Some word that have special meaning can be highlighted by using the <b>bold</b> attribute</p>
        <p> The two properties of attributes are name and value. Each attribute must have these two. You can use attributes on most elements.</p>
